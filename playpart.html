    <h1>Bhavyasree Kalava "acts in a play"</h1>
    <h3>Hedda Gabler By Henrik Ibsen</h3>
    <p>
        A spacious, handsome, and tastefully furnished drawing room, decorated in dark colours. In the back, a wide doorway with curtains drawn back, leading into a smaller room decorated in the same style as the drawing-room. In the right-hand wall of the front room, a folding door leading out to the hall. In the opposite wall, on the left, a glass door, also with curtains drawn back. Through the panes can be seen part of a verandah outside, and trees covered with autumn foliage. An oval table, with a cover on it, and surrounded by chairs, stands well forward. In front, by the wall on the right, a wide stove of dark porcelain, a high-backed arm-chair, a cushioned foot-rest, and two footstools. A settee, with a small round table in front of it, fills the upper right-hand corner. In front, on the left, a little way from the wall, a sofa. Further back than the glass door, a piano. On either side of the doorway at the back a whatnot with terra-cotta and majolica ornaments. Against the back wall of the inner room a sofa, with a table, and one or two chairs. Over the sofa hangs the portrait of a handsome elderly man in a General's uniform. Over the table, a hanging lamp, with an opal glass shade. A number of bouquets are arranged about the drawing-room, in vases and glasses. Others lie upon the tables. The floors in both rooms are covered with thick carpets. Morning light. The sun shines in through the glass door.

      <h3>MISS JULIANA TESMAN</h3>
      <p>
        [Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:] Upon my word, I don't believe they are stirring yet!
      </p>
      
      <h3>BERTA</h3>
      <p>
        [Also softly.] I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.
      </p>
      
      <h3>MISS TESMAN</h3>
      <p>
        Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.
      </p>
      
      <p>[...]</p>
      
      <h3>GEORGE TESMAN</h3>
      <p>
        [In the doorway between the rooms.] Aunt Julia! Dear Aunt Julia! [Goes up to her and shakes hands warmly.] Come all this way--so early! Eh?
      </p>
      
      <h3>MISS TESMAN</h3>
      <p>
        Why, of course I had to come and see how you were getting on.
      </p>
      
      <h3>TESMAN</h3>
      <p>
        In spite of your having had no proper night's rest?
      </p>
      
      <h3>MISS TESMAN</h3>
      <p>
        Oh, that makes no difference to me.
